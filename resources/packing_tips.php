						<h1>Moving Resources - Packing Tips</h1>
						<p><b>Clothing</b> &mdash; Hanging clothing should be packed in wardrobe boxes available from Cord Moving and Storage.  Folded clothing can remain in dresser drawers or packed in medium- sized boxes.  Hats should be left in their boxes whenever possible or packed or wrapped loosely in packing paper and then placed in small boxes.</p>
						<p><b>Draperies/Curtains</b> &mdash; Wardrobe cartons are excellent for moving curtains and drapes.  These items can also be folded, wrapped in packing paper and packed in medium sized/linen boxes.</p>
						<p><b>Mirrors/Paintings/Pictures/Glass tabletops/Wall hangings</b> &mdash; Special cartons are designed to carefully protect these items during the move.  Only one item should be packed in each carton for safe handling. When Cord Moving and Storage packs these items, our skilled packers can double up and reduce your packing expense. Cord Moving and Storage provides professional assistance to crate oversized or heavy items, such as tabletops.</p>
						<p><b>Dishes/Plates/Flat China</b> &mdash; Each item should be wrapped individually in packing paper.  Then gather and bundle approximately three to six wrapped plates into one unit. Begin loading the box with larger items placing the smaller items toward the top. Place each bundle into the box on its side. NEVER lay them flat.  Plates have greater strength when placed on their side.  Once the bottom layer is finished add a few inches of crumpled paper and a cardboard divider, and you are set for the next layer.</p>
						<p><b>Bowls/Glass Bakeware</b> &mdash; Just as with plates, wrap each bowl individually. Then to protect the bowls, nest 2 or 3 together and wrap as one bundle. These items can be placed on end or laid flat. Next, create the second layer by using crumpled paper and a cardboard divider.</p>
						<p><b>Glassware/Barware/Crystal</b> &mdash; Each piece should be individually wrapped in packing paper. Never put pieces inside one another. Place these items on the top level of your carton with the rim placed down.  All fragile items should be packed in a separate carton then packed into a larger carton for added protection.</p>
						<p><b>Glasses/Cups/Mugs</b> &mdash; each item should be wrapped individually and packed with rims down.  Cup and mug handles should be cushioned with packing paper. Separate each layer with crumpled paper for added protection.</p>
						<p><b>Lamps/Shades</b> &mdash; Always disassemble the lampshade from the base. Wrap the harp assembly and the base in packing paper and pack it in a dish pack or similar-type box. Select the carton size closest to the size of the shade measurements and pack only one shade per box. Use loose packing material to cushion the shade, but do not use crumpled packing paper inside or around the shade. Professional packing services should be used for all glass lampshades and chandeliers to ensure safe delivery of those items.</p>
						<p><b>Small Electronics/Clocks/Small Appliances</b> &mdash; Whenever available, manufacturer&rsquo;s packing is the best way to move electronics goods.  If using other packaging, these items should be wrapped well and placed into a large or medium carton. Audio/visual and computer equipment requires special preparation prior to moving.  Always consult your owner&rsquo;s manual for specific instructions. Alert your Cord Moving and Storage relocation specialist to items that need special moving instructions.  Larger home electronics, such as large-screen televisions, should not be packed but moved as furniture. If you are moving a flat-screen plasma televisions, alert your Cord Moving and Storage relocation specialist immediately for special moving instructions and potential crating. Computer systems, servers, grandfather clocks, etc. will require special preparation that should be discussed with your Cord Moving and Storage relocation specialist.</p>
						<p><b>Books</b> &mdash; Pack books into smaller boxes alternating the bindings with the open edges. All books with fragile covers should be wrapped in packing paper for added protection.</p>
						<p><b>Food/Pantry Items</b> &mdash; All dry foods can be packed into medium-sized cartons after taping any and all openings and closing all lids.  Do not pack perishable items or aerosol cans.</p>
						<p><b>Plants/Flowers</b> &mdash; Live plants and potted flowers will not survive a long-distance move.  Artificial/silk flower arrangements must be carefully wrapped and packed individually.</p>
						<p><b>Refrigerators</b> &mdash; Empty all contents and secure all shelving in place or remove and pack.  The electronic cord should be taped to the back of the unit. All icemakers should be disconnected and drained several days in advance of the move.</p>
						<p><b>Labeling</b> &mdash; Always label each carton with contents and the room in which it was packed.  Always label the side, not the top of the carton.</p>
						<h2>Essential Packing Supplies</h2>
						<ul class="bl">
							<li>strong packing boxes from Cord Moving and Storage</li>
							<li>bubble wrap for packing fragile items</li>
							<li>tissue and ink-free packing paper</li>
							<li>scissors</li>
							<li>utility knife for opening boxes</li>

						</ul>
						<h2>Prohibited Items</h2>
						<p>Before your possessions are packed and loaded, it is important to understand which items cannot be shipped because they represent a hazard or are perishable. Listed below are some common, non-allowable items you will need to address prior to your pack and load dates.</p>
						<p><b>Hazardous Materials</b> &mdash; items that are flammable, corrosive or explosive.</p>
						<p>Examples include:</p>
						<p>

						<p><b>Perishables</b> &mdash; food, plants or living things that may die or spoil in transit *</p>
						<p>Examples include:</p>
						<p>
					  <table width="399" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="8">
								<tr>
									<td valign="top" width="133">

						<p><i>* You should empty your refrigerators and freezers and keep appliance doors 	open for at least 24 hours in advance of loading. This will allow appliances to dry 	out and prevent the growth of mold.</i></p>
						<p><b>Items of Personal Importance or Sentimental Value</b> &mdash; These items can create problems should your shipment be delayed or items lost. We suggest that 	irreplaceable items and/or sentimental items be carried with you instead of being 	packed with your shipment.</p>
						<p>Examples include:</p>
						<p>
					  <table width="399" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="8">
								<tr>
									<td valign="top" width="133">

						<h2>More Packing Tips</h2>
						<ul class="bl">
							<li>Get more boxes than you think you will need.</li>
							<li>Get smaller boxes for books and larger boxes for lighter items.</li>
							<li>Pack room-by-room, keeping similar items together.</li>
							<li>Reinforce the bottom of boxes with at least one strip of packing tape.</li>
							<li>Pack cartons firmly to prevent the contents from shifting during your move.</li>
							<li>Use crumpled paper for padding and seal boxes tightly with wide packing tape.</li>
							<li>Pack records, CDs and DVDs vertically in boxes. NEVER stack them flat.</li>
							<li>Use towels, linens, curtains, etc. to pad boxes of fragile items and label the boxes FRAGILE</li>
							<li>When disassembling furniture, beds, lamps, etc., put the hardware in a plastic bag along with any written assembly tips and tape it to the item itself.</li>
							<li>Make a box of essentials and label it &ldquo;OPEN ME FIRST&rdquo; so it is unloaded first or move it yourself. Essential items may include
								<ul>
									<li>basic tools such as flashlights, pocket knife, hammer, screwdrivers, nails, masking tape, light bulbs, etc.</li>
									<li>bathroom essentials &mdash; hand towels, soap, toilet paper, shampoo and shower curtain</li>
									<li>kitchen items &mdash; paper towels, coffeemaker and filters, paper plates and cups, plastic utensils, pet foods, trash bags</li>
								</ul>
